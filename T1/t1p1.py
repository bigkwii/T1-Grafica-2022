    Here's the logo
    Keep in mind the entire thing will be scaled down to fit the aspect ratio,
    so if these x,y,z values seem too large, that's why. 

    l is the size of the "box" containing the logo.
    x , y are the initial coords (will likely remain at 0,0).
    r,g,b are the color.

    As for the logo itself, I picked the Seele logo from the critically acclaimed japanese anime
    series Neon Genesis Evangelion, for a few reasons:
    -It's an asymetric design, so rotations are noticable.
    -It's relatively simple, while still beign quite challenging to make.
    -I like Evangelion.
    -As of March 30th, It's Rei Ayanami's birthday and she's my favorite character from NGE.
